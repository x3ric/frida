## Frida Scripts

A collection of **Frida scripts** that I’ve primarily gathered from **Frida CodeShare** and cleaned up to be more compact and efficient. These scripts are designed for learning and experimentation, focusing on memory hooking, game hacking, bypassing root detection, and SSL pinning. In the **hacks** section, you’ll find my custom hacks for games, developed as part of my exploration into memory hooking with **Frida**.
